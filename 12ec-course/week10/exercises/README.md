# Multimedia data

There are two things you can do

(1) Work with the examples in Chapter 14 in the book. First reproduce them, then
see whether you can use your own images!

(2) Use the notebook [images_as_data.ipynb](../../week10/images_as_data.ipynb)to
get an overview of image loading, processing, and classifying (supervised). You
should run this notebook in Google Colab
