# Web scraping

Write a scraper for a website of your choice. To make things not too complicated, choose a site without cookie walls, login function, etc.

Some hints:

- First start by parsing one single page
- Only then, try to extend to multiple pages
- Be nice! Avoid unnecessary `request`s -- don't re-download the page when trying different parsing options.
