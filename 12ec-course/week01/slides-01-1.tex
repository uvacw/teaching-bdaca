\section{Expectation Management}


\begin{frame}[standout]
	Let's talk a bit about what this course can and cannot offer, and what my and your expectations are.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Expectation 1: The course materials can't offer everything.}
There is a lot of great stuff out there: YouTube tutorials, blogs, \ldots And I don't believe that the way I explain, say, Web Scraping is the one and only way to do it, for each and everyone.

In the end, it is about you learning something -- not about following exactly what I say. If you find a source that you think explains something better than I do: Use it! Share it!
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Expectation 2: Use Stackoverflow. But acknowledge your sources.}
%You'll quickly discover that googling a Python-related question usually takes you to StackOverflow.
Learn from other people's code and don't reinvent the wheel. But indicate in your assignments clearly where you got some code from! 

(Otherwise, I'll report you for plagiarism. And I don't want to do that.)
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[standout]
I don't have to tell you that you can prompt ChatGPT to ``write a for loop in Python''. But next to this being fraud if you hand it in, it -- even more importantly -- won't teach you anything. Also, in case of suspicious code (e.g., code using very different idioms and approaches than we discussed), I'll reserve the right to question you to explain what's happening.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Expectation 3: You have to practice.}
	You have to practice, preferably with a classmate. Try to modify the code we used, or write something (anything) on your own. Use the Friday sessions to ask for feedback on that.
\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Expectation 4: The first weeks are crucial.}
The first weeks are crucial, really. REALLY. REALLY!!!

Maybe quite counterintuitively, the fancy stuff we are doing later (Machine Learning\ldots) is relatively easy to do. But only if you know your basics %(as in: be able to explain Chapter 3 of the book in the middle of the night to your grandparents)

Want to take it easy some weeks? Better do so later in the course ;-)
\end{frame}






\begin{frame}{Expectation 5: You are an individual.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item There is wide variation of how quickly people ``get it'' in the first weeks. You are not stupid if it takes a bit longer!
	\item In the end, you will need to deliver an individual research project on a topic of your own choice.
	\item You should consult me on the exact scope, but it needs to include multiple techniques from both parts of the course.
	\item Some students say they prefer more standardized testing, but that would be \emph{in conflict with the main learning goal of this course}: Being able to conduct a CSS reseach project, from beginning to end.
	\item But most students actually find this one of the best things of this course, and so do I: It's great to read all your creative work!
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}




\begin{frame}{Structure of the meetings (usually)}
	\begin{description}
		\item[Wednesday] Lecture
		\item[Friday]Lab session.
	\end{description}
See Course Manual for specific preparation and readings.

In general, we will work on some programming exercise \emph{during} the lab sessions, so that you can immediately ask questions when you get stuck.

No weekly assignments to hand in, but implicit continous assignment: Finish the exercises we do in class, and play with them/extend them/write your own code!
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Two take-home exams and one individual project
	\item Reserve some time for the take-home exams (sometimes, it helps to sleep a night)
	\item In the exams, you need to program, but also have read the literature
	\item For details, see Course Manual
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\question{Any questions?}




\begin{frame}[standout]
	Make sure you can run Python code and install packages. Otherwise, you won't be able to follow along on Friday. (See instructions you got.)
