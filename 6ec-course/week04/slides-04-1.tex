\question{Everything clear from last week?}


\begin{frame}{Main points from last week}

\begin{alertblock}{I assume that by now, everybody knows:}
\begin{itemize}
\item how to read and write different types of files
\item how to work with both nested and tabular data
\item how to deal with data of an unknown structure (such as responses from an unfamiliar JSON API)
\item \ldots and of course all the basics: data types, for loops, conditions, etc.
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[standout]
This week, we will look into tabular, relatively traditional data. But remember what we said last week about different data structures -- we will work with them a lot as well in the upcoming weeks!
