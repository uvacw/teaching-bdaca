Teaching materials for BDACA and related courses

This repository contains all teaching materials for the courses "Big Data and Automated Content Analysis" (6 EC) and "Big Data and Automated Content Analysis Part I and II" (12 EC), taught by Anne Kroon and/or Damian Trilling. 

The courses are based on the [book](https://cssbook.net/), *Computational Analysis of Communication: A practical introduction to the analysis of texts, networks, and images with code examples in Python and R* by Wouter van Atteveldt, Damian Trilling, and Carlos Arcila Calderon, and are taught in Python.

This repository is continously updated to reflect the most current edition of the courses. 


### Previous versions

Of course, you can use the commit history to travel back in time, if you are interested to see how the course has changed over time. Additionally, for the sake of completeness, we also keep old repositories that we used until 2021 (i.e., before we switched to the new book) available (e.g., [here](https://github.com/annekroon/bdaca-6ec) and [here](https://github.com/damian0604/bdaca)). Note that the code there is partly outdated, does not follow best practice any more, contains outdated examples, etc.
