\emph{(Note: In this chapter``advanced research designs and methods'' in the following refers to techniques of computational communication science as covered in Part I (basic text processing, data retrieval from web sources) and Part II (supervised machine laring, and unsupervised machine learning) of this course).}

\chapter{Planning of testing and teaching}

The seminar consists of 28 meetings, two per week. Each week, in the first meeting, the instructor will give short lectures on the key aspects of the week, followed by seminar-style discussions. Theoretical considerations regarding Big Data and Automated Content Analysis are discussed, and techniques for analyzing Big Data are presented. We also discuss examples from the literature, in which these techniques are applied.


The second meetings each week are practicum-meetings, in which the students will apply what the techniques they have learned to own data sets. Here, they can also deepen their understanding of software tools, prepare their projects and get hands-on help. While there are in-class assignments as well as occasional assignments for at home (e.g., completing an online-tutorial to prepare for class), these are not graded.


To complete the course, next to active participation, the students have to successfully complete three summative graded assignments: two mid-term take-home exam and an individual project, in which they derive an empirical question from a theoretical starting point, and then do an Automated Content Analysis to answer the question. See Chapter 7 for details.

\section*{Grading}

The final grade of this course will be composed of the grade of two mid-term take home exams ($2 \times 20$\%) and one individual project (60\%).

\subsection*{Mid-term take-home exam ($2 \times 20$\%}
In two mid-term take-home exam, students will show their understanding of the literature and prove they have gained new insights during the lecture/seminar meetings. They will be asked to critically assess various approaches to Big Data analysis and make own suggestions for research. Additionally, they need to (partly) write the code to accomplish this.

Grading criteria are communicated to the students together with the assignment, but in general are:
For literature-related tasks in the exam:
\begin{itemize}
	\item usage of specific examples from the literature;
	\item critique of different approaches;
	\item nameing of pro's, con's, potential pitfalls, and alternatives;
	\item giving practical advice and guidance.
\end{itemize}
For programming-related tasks in the exam:
\begin{itemize}
	\item correctness, efficiency, and style of the code
	\item correctness, completeness, and usefulness of analyses applied.
\end{itemize}
For conceptual and planning-related tasks:
\begin{itemize}
	\item feasibility
	\item level of specificity
	\item explanation and argumentation why a specific approach is chosen
	\item creativity.
\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Final individual project (60\%)}
The final individual project typically consists of the following elements, which all contribute to the final grade:
\begin{itemize}
\item introduction including references to relevant (course) literature, an overarching research question plus subquestions and/or hypotheses (1–2 pages);
\item an overview of the analytic strategy, referring to relevant methods learned in this course;
\item carefully collected and relevant dataset of non-trivial size;
\item a set of scripts for collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing the data. The scripts should be well-documented and tailored to the specific needs of the own project;
\item output files;
\item a well-substantiated conclusion with an answer to the RQ and directions for future research.
\end{itemize}

Depending on the choosen topic, the student will have to apply multiple, but not all, techniques covered in the course. In particular, the student needs to spend a substantial amount of the project on a technique covered in Part II of this course. Student and teacher discuss the scope of the projects, the requirements that the specific project suggested by the student needs to fulfill, and the extend to which the different methods that the student plans to use will contribute to the final grade.

\subsection*{Grading and 2\textsuperscript{nd} try}
Students have to get a pass (5.5 or higher) for both mid-term take-home exams and the individual project. If the grade of one of these is lower, an improved version can be handed in within one week after the grade is communicated to the student. If the improved version still is graded lower than 5.5, the course cannot be completed. Improved versions of the final individual project cannot be graded higher than 6.0.

\item Feedback and grading final projects, including feedback on proposal and individual counseling: 17* 90 min: 25 hours 
\item Administration, e-mails, individual appointments: 10 hours
\end{itemize}
Total: 240 hours


\chapter{History of the course}
In response to the feedback by the test review committee in 2019, the following changes were applied:
\begin{itemize}
\item Empasized in the section ``Exit qualification'' that -- in contrast to the 6 ECTS course -- knowledge of \emph{both} techniques from Part I (basic text processing, data retrieval from web sources) and Part II (supervised machine laring, and unsupervised machine learning) need to be demonstrated in the final project.
\item Empasized the same in the section ``Grading''
\item Added specific grading criteria to the section ``Grading''
\end{itemize}

In 2022, the course received a thorough update due to the publication of the new textbook \citep{cssbook}.

In 2023, the course was updated to incorporate recent developments in machine learning. This was achieved by devoting less attention to now obsolete techniques that are mainly of historical interest, but are not considered best practice any more.

In 2024, the sessions on unsupervised machine learning and multimedia data were switched to make it easier for students to come up with ideas and data collections for final projects involving multimedia data (e.g. images, videos).
