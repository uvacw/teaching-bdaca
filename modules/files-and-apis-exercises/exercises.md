# Exercises for working with files and a simple API

## 1. Working with CSV files

1. Take a dataset of your choice - something from your own work maybe. If it is not a CSV file (but, for instance, an Excel sheet or an SPSS file), export it as CSV. Inspect the file in a text editor of your choice (such as the ones available at https://www.sublimetext.com/, https://notepad-plus-plus.org, or https://atom.io or https://code.visualstudio.com) and check:
- the encoding
- the line ending style
- the delimiter
- whether it has a header row or not
- take a quick look and check whether the file looks "ok", i.e. all rows have equal number of fields etc.


2. Open your file in Python and write it back (with a different file name). Do so both with the low-level (basic Python) and the high-level (pandas) approach. Inspect the result again in the editor and compare. (NB: Depending on the dialect, there may be small differences. If you observe some, which are they?)


## 2. Working with JSON files and APIs

1. Reproduce examples 12.1, 12.2, and 12.3 from the book. Explain the code to a classmate.

2. Think of different ways of storing the data you collected. What would be the pros and cons? Discuss with a classmate.

3. What do you think of example 12.2 (or line 12 in example 12.3, for that matter)? Would you rather store your data *before* or *after* the `json_normalize()` function? Discuss with a classmate. (NB: there are arguments to be made for both)

4. What would happen if you would directly create a dataframe (e.g., via `pd.Dataframe(allitems)`, `pd.Dataframe(data['items'])`, or similar)? Based on this observation, can you describe what `json_normalize()` does?


## 3. Transform your data!
Go back to your dataset from Exercise 1, or choose a new one, or take the data from Exercise 2. Transform the dataset back and forth between

- CSVs with different encodings and different dialects;
- JSON;
- JSON-lines;
- (if it makes sense) plain text files.

Use different tools for that (e.g., pandas and/or basic Python). Also, inspect the different versions using a text editor. Discuss differences with your neighbour.



## 4. Bonus-exercise
In case you have time left or do not feel challenged enough: Try to write loop that iterates over a nested data structure (like the data you retrieve from the GoogleBooks API) and collects some statistic (say, the length of some entry) or some subset of the data that you find interesting. Store this in a flatter dictionary or in a list. 

Then, try to improve your code by replacing the inner part of your loop by one or more self-written functions.
